# Conference-Organization-App
Cloud-based API server to support a provided conference organization application using Google App Engine with Python.

## Design choices made for adding Sessions to a Conference

* The same approach used to create a new Conference was followed, so, as well as there is an attribute in Conference model
called `organizerUserId` to store the relationship with the user, in Session model there is an attribute called 
`conferenceId`, with the difference that the type used was `ndb.KeyProperty`. 
* To obtain all sessions given a conference key, inheritance was used.
* To store the speaker a String field was used, this can be improved, maybe using a new Entity, but for simplicity 
this option was used.

## Indexes and queries
In this part, indexes and querys for sessions where added:

* Endpoint to filter sessions by highlights (`getConferenceSessionsByHighlight`).
* Endpoint to filter sessions by date (`getConferenceSessionsByDate`). The result contains all the records with 
the date greater (or equal) than the one specified.
* The `index.yaml` file was updated automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver detects that a new type of 
query is run.

## Query related problem
> Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query 
  for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query? What ways to 
  solve it did you think of?
    
In this case the first try was:

```
sevenPm = datetime.strptime("19:00", '%H:%M').time()
sessions = Session.query(ancestor=conf)
sessions = sessions.filter(Session.typeOfSession != "Workshop")
sessions = sessions.filter(Session.startTime < sevenPm)
```

But it throws the following Exception:

```
Encountered unexpected error from ProtoRPC method implementation: BadRequestError (Only one inequality filter per 
query is supported. Encountered both typeOfSession and startTime)
```

To solve the problem, I leave only one inequaly filter and iterate over the results to detect every session under 
seven pm.

```
sevenPm = datetime.strptime("19:00", '%H:%M').time()
sessions = Session.query(ancestor=conf)
sessions = sessions.filter(Session.typeOfSession != "Workshop")
return SessionForms(items=[self._copySessionToForm(session) for session in sessions
                           if session.startTime < sevenPm])
```
